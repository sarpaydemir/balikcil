15_event_collapse.py -- the event-collapse engine RULES 13 / TACTICS 7 need.

What it does
------------
Turns a list of moments (id, coin, kind, start hour) into a PARTITION into
events, under every candidate reading of "the same hour" that the written
rules allow, and measures each reading. It then calibrates what collapsing
does to a shuffle: the 1% boundary of the null distribution under a card-level
shuffle (what TACTICS 7 says today, uncollapsed) against a cluster-level
(block) shuffle over the events.

It also exposes `collapse()`, `identity_map()`, `block_shuffle_indices()`,
`check_block_shuffle()` and `chance_line()` so the later judge script imports
the same code instead of writing the rule a second time.

Input   : cards/C###.md  (default)  -- or --moments CSV with columns
          id,coin,kind,start_hour_utc  (ISO, e.g. 2026-05-07T20:00Z)
Output  : <out>/run-<run16>/events.csv
          <out>/run-<run16>/collapse-summary.csv
          <out>/run-<run16>/shuffle-calibration.csv
          <out>/run-<run16>/collapse-manifest.md
          <out>/runs/<run16>.json   (append-only)
          (<out> defaults to exam-prep/collapse.)

Changes made in the second-fix run (2026-10-01), acting on exam-prep/REVIEW.md
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The version reviewed is git commit 7735d08, SHA-256 f3de2358...fb12; its run
`386d234b85269a21` and its outputs in exam-prep/collapse/ are kept untouched.
  1. block_shuffle_indices() is replaced (REVIEW §4.2). The reviewed version
     paired card positions index by index across events of different sizes,
     so it did not keep events whole. The replacement moves an event only onto
     an event of the same size, so every event reads all its answers from one
     source event and keeps its internal pattern. An event whose size no other
     event shares cannot move; check_block_shuffle() counts those.
  2. check_block_shuffle() tests the contract the docstring states (REVIEW
     §4.5 item 2). main() runs it on every configuration and on the review's
     three-event example before measuring, and stops on any failure.
     chance_line() also checks every block draw it makes.
  3. collapse() returns an EventMap: a list of events that also carries the
     configuration that made it and the moments it was made from.
     chance_line() refuses anything else, re-derives the map from its own
     moments and configuration before using it, and returns a record that
     carries the configuration, the event-map fingerprint and the counts
     (REVIEW §4.3, §4.5 item 4). The uncollapsed map can still be had, but
     only as identity_map(), which labels itself `none/none/none`.
  4. representative mode takes the full event map plus the caller's choice of
     one representative per event, instead of a pre-reduced list, so that the
     configuration survives into the record. Which card represents an event,
     and what label an event holding both kinds carries, remain open
     questions (exam-prep/second-fix/juror-questions/JQ-N1.md); this file
     does not choose either.
  5. Outputs go to a per-run directory and are never overwritten (RULES 30).
  6. The summary gains: events holding two or more cards of one coin, the
     largest such count (REVIEW §4.4), and the events and cards a block
     shuffle cannot move.

Changes made in the third-fix run (2026-10-01), acting on exam-prep/REVIEW-2.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The version REVIEW-2 reviewed has SHA-256 a0bcc600...8280 (recorded in
exam-prep/review-2/FINGERPRINTS.md); its run `756cf4ea156d92c3` and outputs
in exam-prep/collapse/run-756cf4ea156d92c3/ are kept untouched.
  7. chance_line() takes a REQUIRED keyword argument `key_moments_sha256` and
     refuses to run unless it equals the fingerprint of the moments the event
     map was made from (REVIEW-2 §4.3: an event map built by collapse() from
     forged moments was accepted under a collapsed label). The judge computes
     that value with moments_fingerprint() from the moments read out of the
     SEALED ANSWER KEY -- never from the event map itself, which would check
     nothing. The record carries `key_moments_sha256` and
     `key_check: "matched"`. This makes the comparison impossible to forget;
     it cannot by itself prove that the caller read the key, which is why
     exam-prep/HANDED-FORWARD.md requires it of the judge's script.
  8. moments_fingerprint(moments): the same canonical fingerprint as
     EventMap.moments_sha256(), computable from a plain moment list.
  9. main() passes the fingerprint of the moments it read (the cards, or the
     --moments CSV) and nothing else changed; events.csv, the summary and the
     calibration are expected byte-identical to run 756cf4ea156d92c3.

Rules implemented
-----------------
RULES 13  : "Moments occurring in several coins in the same hour count as a
            single event."  This script does not CHOOSE which reading of that
            sentence is right -- it builds all of them and measures them. The
            choice is an open question under RULES 33 and is named in
            exam-prep/N-1-collapse.md.
TACTICS 7 : "A moment appearing in several cards in the same hour counts as a
            single event."  Same sentence, same treatment.
RULES 12  : the shuffle count (1000) and the 1% boundary come from this rule,
            not from here.
RULES 19  : every number written is counted; nothing is estimated.
RULES 23  : the clock is read from the system.
RULES 28  : free disk space is read and recorded (no download happens).
RULES 29  : the run number is the SHA-256 of the inputs, including this file.
RULES 30  : the run record is append-only; differing content stops the script.

Constants -- where each came from
---------------------------------
SHUFFLES = 1000        RULES 12: "the answers are shuffled 1,000 times".
TOP_FRACTION = 0.01    RULES 12: "the real result must fall inside the best 1%".
SEED = 20260913        TACTICS 1's draw number, "written before the draw; it
                       does not change". Not a number chosen here.
MOVE_WINDOW_HOURS = 24 TACTICS 2: a moment is a 24-hour movement.
CARD_SPAN_HOURS  = 48  TACTICS 3 / the card text: before 24 h + after 24 h.
SELFTEST_DRAWS = 1000  the number of block draws each self-test makes: RULES
                       12's shuffle count, so the test sees every draw a
                       chance line would make.

No threshold, score or trading rule is defined anywhere in this file.
