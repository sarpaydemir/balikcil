29_identity_audit_exact.py -- does a card tell you which coin it is, and when?
(the identity audit of scripts/16_identity_audit.py, with distances compared
exactly -- fourth-fix run, 2026-10-01; see "Changes made in the fourth-fix
run" at the end of this comment block)

What it does
------------
Runs three fixed attacks against a folder of cards, using ONLY what an exam
candidate can see (the Before section: its bullet lines and its table), and
measures each attack against a chance line built by permutation.

  T1 · coin identification. Leave-one-out nearest neighbour over a family of
       features: is the nearest card the same coin? Chance line: the same
       measurement after the coin labels are shuffled 1,000 times.
  T2 · coin linkage. Over every pair of cards, can the distance tell a
       same-coin pair from a different-coin pair (area under the ROC curve)?
       Same chance line.
  T3 · clock-hour linkage. Do two cards print three consecutive rows that are
       identical in a given column set? Measured against the true shared-hour
       map, so it reports a detection rate and a false-positive rate.

It reports per feature family, so that a family that leaks can be named.

Input   : a folder of cards (default `cards/`), plus a truth file mapping card
          -> coin, kind, start hour. For the raw cards the truth is on the card
          itself; for a blinded set it is passed with --truth.
Output  : <out>/identity-audit.csv
          <out>/identity-audit.md
          <out>/runs/<run16>.json   (append-only)

Rules implemented
-----------------
RULES 9  : "In the exam the coin name and the date are hidden." This script
           measures whether that holds in fact, rather than assuming it.
RULES 12 : 1,000 shuffles, the boundary of the best 1%. Both numbers come from
           that rule.
RULES 19 : every number is counted; nothing is estimated.
RULES 20 : where an attack finds nothing, the attack and its inputs are still
           written down, so "no leak" is not a bare claim.
RULES 23 : the clock is read from the system.
RULES 29 / 30 : run number = SHA-256 of the inputs; records are append-only.

Constants -- where each came from
---------------------------------
SHUFFLES = 1000      RULES 12.
TOP_FRACTION = 0.01  RULES 12.
SEED = 20260913      TACTICS 1's draw number.
RUN_LEN = 3          T3 asks for three consecutive identical rows. Three is the
                     same length the canteen book's B-4 uses for "a repeated
                     value", taken from there so that no new number is invented
                     here; it is the shortest run any watcher card-verified.

No threshold, score or trading rule is defined anywhere in this file.

Changes made in the second-fix run (2026-10-01), acting on exam-prep/REVIEW.md
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The version reviewed is git commit 7735d08 (SHA-256 4c4928b8...a371); its runs
and outputs in exam-prep/identity/ are kept untouched.
  1. Repeat-structure features (REVIEW §3.2 and §3.6 item 2, criterion K-2 of
     exam-prep/second-fix/criteria-written-before-measuring.md): for every
     column printed in the before table except `h`, the number of distinct
     printed values over the 24 rows and the largest number of rows sharing
     one printed value. One family per column group, `repeat-<group>`.
     `repeat-chg` reads `chg%`, which is printed unchanged for the frozen
     book's S-1, so it is forced and stays out of `ALL-removable`; every other
     `repeat-*` family is removable and is inside it.
  2. FORCED_FAMILIES names, once, the families left out of `ALL-removable`;
     18_residual_diagnostic.py reads it from here instead of retyping it.
  3. T3 gains a bullet-line row: the US release line, exact match, the
     default "none" text excluded (REVIEW §1.1: the reviewed T3 looked at
     columns only).
  4. T4, new: release names that occur on exactly one calendar day of the
     card set, and the cards that carry one (REVIEW §3.4). It needs the truth
     file; it is a count, not an attack with a chance line.
  5. The report prints the gate rows (`ALL-removable`, both attacks) in a
     section of their own and does not say which attack decides the gate:
     that is open question JQ-R04-GATE
     (exam-prep/second-fix/juror-questions/JQ-R04-GATE.md).
  6. Outputs go to <out>/run-<run16>/ and are never overwritten (RULES 30).

Changes made in the third-fix run (2026-10-01), acting on exam-prep/REVIEW-2.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The version reviewed by REVIEW-2 has SHA-256 4dfd9fd1...7a91 (recorded in
exam-prep/review-2/FINGERPRINTS.md); its runs and outputs are kept untouched.
Criteria written before these changes were measured:
exam-prep/third-fix/criteria-written-before-measuring.md (K-5, K-6, K-7).
  7. Nearest neighbour without card-order dependence (REVIEW-2 §4.1, K-6).
     The reviewed nearest-neighbour score breaks distance ties by the lowest
     card index, so with whole-number features it is a property of the card
     numbering. That score is still computed and printed unchanged (column
     `nn_same_coin_accuracy`), and next to it:
       - `nn_tie_free`: for every card, the share of its equally-nearest other
         cards that are the same coin, averaged over cards -- the exact mean of
         the reviewed score over every tie-break; it does not depend on card
         order. Its own chance line is computed from the same 1,000 label
         shuffles (`nn_tie_free_chance_1pct`).
       - `nn_tie_low` / `nn_tie_high`: the lowest and highest value the
         reviewed score can take over all tie-breaks, and
         `cards_with_tied_nn`, the number of cards whose nearest neighbour is
         not unique.
     Where there are no ties the three scores are equal.
  8. The K-4 granularity probe joins the audit as family `granularity-close`
     (REVIEW-2 §4.2, K-5): the smallest non-zero difference between two
     printed `close` values of a card's before table, computed on the printed
     decimal text with exact decimal arithmetic -- not on parsed floats, which
     is the defect REVIEW-2 found in 25_instrument_checks.py E-3. `close` is
     not printed unchanged (it is rebased), so by K-2's rule the family is
     removable and sits inside `ALL` and `ALL-removable`.
  9. T4 also counts by the day a release falls (card start hour + the printed
     offset), not only by the day the card starts (REVIEW-2 §4.4). A name
     printed without an offset is keyed by the card's start day, as stated
     in the report. Both are within-set counts, not publication frequency.
 10. T3 strips the unit suffix of a blinded column name (`quote vol r` ->
     `quote vol`), as card_features() already did, so its `quote vol` row
     sees the ranked column on a blinded set instead of reporting it as not
     printed (SECOND-FIX §4 item 3 named this blind spot and left it).

Changes made in the fourth-fix run (2026-10-01), acting on exam-prep/REVIEW-3.md
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file started as a byte copy of scripts/16_identity_audit.py, third-fix
version, SHA-256 4a248f78c78376c3b58ce7b02bc20af2c035e8089529449d303c70061164f4da.
That script is NOT changed: the juror file for JQ-R04-GATE names it as the
source of its figures, and jurors are answering that file. Its runs stay
what they are. Criterion: exam-prep/fourth-fix/criteria-written-before-
measuring.md, K-13.
 11. Distances are compared exactly (REVIEW-3 §4.1). Script 16 found
     nearest-neighbour ties by float equality of distances computed from
     z-scored floats, so two distances equal in exact arithmetic could differ
     in the last bit and not count as tied (and two distances that differ by
     less than float error could be ordered wrongly). Here the squared
     distance between two cards is sum_k (x_ik - x_jk)^2 / v_k, where x is
     each feature value exactly as computed (a float, taken as the exact
     rational it represents) and v_k is the exact sample variance (divisor
     n - 1) of feature k over the card set: the squared distance between the
     z-scored vectors in exact arithmetic. It is computed in integers after
     one common scaling (exact_distance_codes()), and every distance is then
     replaced by its rank among the distinct exact values, which keeps order
     and equality exactly. Nearest neighbour (index tie-break), tie sets, tie
     range, tie-free score and the pair ranks of the pair AUC all read those
     codes. Which features a family uses is decided by standardise() exactly
     as in script 16, so `features_used` does not change; a feature whose
     exact variance is zero contributes zero to every distance. Nothing else
     changes: features, families, shuffles, seed, chance lines, T3, T4.
