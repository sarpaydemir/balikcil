## Current time (read from the system)

!`date -u '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M UTC'`

## Tail of the ledger

!`tail -n 12 "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/LEDGER.md"`

## Length before this entry

!`wc -l < "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/LEDGER.md"` lines

## The task

Subject: **$ARGUMENTS**

A single entry is **appended** to `LEDGER.md`. The rule: *append-only, no line
is ever deleted.*

1. **Use the time printed above.** Do not guess it, do not recall it, do not take
   it from anywhere else (RULES 23). Whatever is printed above is the time.
2. **Write the entry in English.** The laboratory's working language is English.
   Entries before 2026-09-18 are in Turkish; they are history and are not
   touched.
3. Write the entry in this shape:

   ```
   `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC` · **short label** · what happened. What it rests on,
   which file, the fingerprint if there is one. Never write an unmeasured
   number; if it is an estimate write "estimate" next to it (RULES 19).
   ```

4. **Append to the end of the file only.** Touch no existing line. Append with
   `>>`; do not rewrite the whole file with the `Write` tool — rewriting risks
   losing old lines.
5. After appending, verify the line count **grew.** If it shrank or stayed the
   same, stop and tell the user.
6. **Commit and push.** Stage the changed files, commit with a one-line message
   naming the entry's label, and push to `origin main`. Records that are pushed
   are records that survive (RULES 29–30). Every ledger entry is one commit, so
   the git history and the ledger tell the same story.

   If the push fails, say so — a failed push is a technical failure and a
   technical failure is not a result (RULES 21). Do not carry on as if the
   record were safe.

   When printing git output, never print the remote URL: the token is embedded
   in it. Filter it:
   `git push origin main 2>&1 | sed -E 's/github_pat_[A-Za-z0-9_]+/***/g'`

## What must go into an entry

- If a **decision** was taken: who took it (the user or the coordinator) and
  which rule it supersedes.
- If a **run** happened: the run number (the fingerprint of the input) and the
  output file (RULES 29).
- If something was **sealed**: the fingerprint of the answer key (RULES 9).
- If a **rule changed**: a note that the user was asked first.
- If there is an **estimate**: the word "estimate" next to it.
- If something **could not be measured**: by name. "Could not be measured" never
  turns into "no problem" (RULES 22).
