RATIFIED

## Six checks

**1. Count:** Three answers present (juror-1, juror-2, juror-3). ✓

**2. Independence:** Each juror states they read independently without seeing other answers. All cite identical measured values (26 vs 68 countable notes, 90,152 vs 101,346 tokens) from the same pilot file, but this is objective data, not echoing. Their reasoning, emphasis, and objections differ substantially: juror-1 emphasizes the per-token quality ratio; juror-2 emphasizes the absence of an invoked weighting and the structural difference in output; juror-3 counts five separate quality proxies and flags formatting artefacts. No quoting of one another detected. ✓

**3. Grounding:** All three answers cite files and lines abundantly:
- Juror-1: TACTICS.md section 4, data/pilot/2026-09-19-pilot-measurements.md tables with specific lines, notes files with line numbers.
- Juror-2: TACTICS.md lines 75 and 81–82, pilot file line 11, lines 22–23, and 40, notes files with line numbers.
- Juror-3: TACTICS.md lines 75 and 81–82, pilot file lines 11–14 and 20–25, notes files with line numbers.
All three are thoroughly grounded. ✓

**4. Outcome and split:** All three jurors answer **effort `high`** for the observation run. The measured ratios are 2.6x countable notes (26 vs 68) for a 1.124x token cost (90,152 vs 101,346). Split: **3–0** (unanimous).

**5. Reasoned objection (RULES 32):** Both juror-1 (objection a, lines 142–158) and juror-3 (objection b, lines 142–163) raise the same reasoned concern: the instructions differ in four lines including "role", meaning the agents ran under two different definitions (`watcher` and `watcher-high`). If those definitions differ in any text beyond effort, the pilot is confounded. Both state they could not verify this because `.claude/agents/` was closed to them. Juror-3 calls it "the objection most likely to overturn my answer."

**This objection does not stand.** I compared `/home/user/balikcil/.claude/agents/watcher.md` and `/home/user/balikcil/.claude/agents/watcher-high.md` line by line. The two files differ in exactly three ways:
- Line 2: `name:` (watcher vs watcher-high)
- Line 3: `description:` (the second mentions "at effort high")
- Line 6: `effort:` (medium vs high)

Every line of substantive content from line 11 onwards is word-for-word identical. The definitions themselves state (lines 19–21 of both):

> **Nothing else differs.** If you ever find a difference between the two other than the effort line, the name, the description and this paragraph, stop and report it — the comparison would be invalid.

The definitions explicitly acknowledge that name, description, and effort are expected to differ. The pilot is not confounded. The factual basis of the objection is false, so the objection does not stand. ✓

**6. Scope:** RULES 33 limits jurors to "procedure and definition only: never a trading rule, never a threshold or score, and never a change to a rule in this file."

All three decide which effort level to use for the observation run (TACTICS 4, the pilot's follow-up). This is a procedure choice, not a trading rule, threshold, score, or amendment to RULES.md. All three stay within scope. Juror-1 and juror-2 correctly note that acting on this answer requires editing TEAM.md (lines 154/156), but both flag that such edits are the coordinator's decision, not theirs (juror-1 lines 128–136; juror-2 lines 106–110). ✓

## Comparison of agent definitions

Both definitions are identical in their substantive working text (lines 11–137). They differ only in:

**Header metadata (lines 1–8):**
- Line 2: `name` field — `watcher` vs `watcher-high`
- Line 3: `description` field — `Balıkçıl's watcher` vs `Balıkçıl's watcher at effort high`
- Line 6: `effort` field — `medium` vs `high`

**Why there are two definitions (lines 11–21):**
Both files carry this identical paragraph, including the explicit statement that "Nothing else differs" and that differences in "the effort line, the name, the description and this paragraph" are expected and acceptable.

**Every other section (lines 23–137):**
Word-for-word identical: Working language, Who you are, The card in front of you, Note format, If you write an idea, Four things you must know, Honesty, The wall, Round, Your report.

**Conclusion:** The two definitions differ only in name, description, and effort level — exactly the differences the definitions themselves say are permissible. The pilot is a clean comparison.

## The discrepancy in the juror instruction

The instruction to jurors (line 18–19) states: "Its two arms read the same ten cards with the same field of view and the same instruction, **differing only in effort level.**"

The measurement file states (line 5–6): "Instructions: ... **differ in four lines (title, role, effort, output path).**"

This is a simplification in the juror instruction. Both juror-1 (lines 270–272) and juror-3 (lines 248–261) noticed and flagged this discrepancy. The instruction was slightly over-tidy but not deceptive: it omits mention of the four lines but offers a null outcome as an option and names no winner. The measured file is more precise and both observant jurors caught the gap. This is not a steer.

## Final ruling

Three grounded, independent answers all choose **effort `high`** unanimously. The objections raised about agent-definition confounding do not stand: the definitions are verified to differ only in acknowledged ways. Jurors stay within scope. No reasoned blocker holds.

**RATIFIED** — effort level `high` is selected for the observation run, on the evidence the pilot produced. Split: **3–0**.
